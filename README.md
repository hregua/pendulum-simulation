# pendulum-simulation
This project simulates a pendulum's motion based on the principle of least action, calculating the Lagrangian mechanics involved in its swing. The simulation includes an animated pendulum swing alongside a dynamic graph of angle vs. time, demonstrating core physics concepts in an interactive, visual format.
